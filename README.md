## FAQs
* ### How to get an **order token** ?
    To generate an order token, refer to our API documentation on our [API Referece](https://docs.deuna.com/reference/order_token)

* ### How to get an **user token** ?
    You'll need a registered user in DEUNA. Follow the instructions for ["User Registration"](https://docs.deuna.com/reference/users-register) in our API reference.

    Once you have a registered user, you can obtain an access token through a two-step process:

    **Request an OTP code**: Use our API for "[Requesting an OTP Code](https://docs.deuna.com/reference/request-otp)" via email.

    **Login with OTP code:** Use the retrieved code to "[Log in with OTP](https://docs.deuna.com/reference/login-with-otp)" and get an access token for your user.
